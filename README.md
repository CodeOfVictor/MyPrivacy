⚠️This project is under development, please wait to final release!⚠️

⚠️The code may not be complete or may contain errors.⚠️


## Description
The vast majority of websites or programs for notes, to-do's, calendars with events ... work by storing data on servers, making private information vulnerable or public.


That is why we have created this project which saves everything locally and encrypted, being YOU THE OWNER OF YOUR DATA and no one else can access it.
